    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>

    Documents and downloadable media are made available to the networkthrough web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers.Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and locatedthrough character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). Theoriginal and still very common document type is a web page formatted inHypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plaintext, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (shortprograms) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language alsosupports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access toother web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the commonpractice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Webapplications are web pages that function as application software. Theinformation in the Web is transferred across the Internet using theHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.
    The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant software platform. It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.
    The Web was originally conceived as a document management system. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.</p>
